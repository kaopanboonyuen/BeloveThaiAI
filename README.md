### 🛠️ Key Features of the AI Model 🛠️
- **Behavior Detection:** 🎥 Using ML algorithms to analyze footage and detect animal behaviors like feeding, mating, migration, and more. 👀  
- **Location Tracking:** 📍 Integrating geospatial data to track animal movement across Thailand’s diverse landscapes. 🌳  
- **Endemic Species Focus:** 🦇 The model will focus on Thailand’s 8 endemic mammals, 2 endemic birds, and many reptiles and amphibians! 🦎

### 🦧 AI Model Use Cases 🚀
1. **Wildlife Conservation:** 🌍 Our AI model will help track endangered species, identify critical habitats, and detect threats to their survival. 🐾  
2. **Human-Animal Interaction:** 🤝 Understand how animals interact with their environment, helping humans and wildlife coexist. 🌿  
3. **Research & Education:** 📚 Providing valuable data to researchers, conservationists, and educators to protect Thailand’s biodiversity! 🧠

## 🦸‍♂️ Thailand’s Unique Wildlife: Key Species 🦸‍♀️

Thailand is home to several **endemic species** found nowhere else on the planet 🌏. Our AI model will help track and protect these species, including:

### **Endemic Mammals** 🐾
- **Kitti’s Hog-nosed Bat** (Craseonycteris thonglongyai) 🦇
- **Marshall's Leaf-nosed Bat** (Rhinolophus marshalli) 🦇
- **Giant Leaf-nosed Bat** (Hipposideros halophyllus) 🦇
- **Saratthani Brown Water Bat** (Eptesicus demissus) 🦇
- **Limestone Rat** (Niviventer hinpoon) 🐀
- **Bangkachak Rat** (Bandicota bangchakensis) 🐀
- **Cave Rat** (Leopoldamys neilli) 🐀
- **Schomburgk’s Deer** (Cervus schomburgki) 🦌

### **Endemic Birds** 🦜
- **Sirindhorn’s White-eyed River-Martin** (Pseudochelidon sirintarae) 🐦  
- **Deignan's Babbler** (Stachyris rodolphei) 🐦

### **Endemic Reptiles & Amphibians** 🦎
- **31 Reptiles** 🐍  
- **13 Amphibians** 🐸

## 🤖 AI Technology Stack 💻

**BeloveThaiAI** will use an all-star team of technologies to get the job done! 🚀

- **Computer Vision:** 🖼️ Analyzing images and video to detect animal behaviors with precision. 🎯  
- **Geospatial Analytics:** 📍 Tracking animal movements using GPS and satellite data to understand migration and habitat. 🌍  
- **Deep Learning:** 🤖 Using neural networks to classify species and track animal behavior in real-time.  
- **IoT Integration:** 🌐 Collecting data from wildlife cameras, acoustic sensors, and GPS trackers to feed our AI model.

## 💥 Why This Project Matters 🌍

Thailand's unique wildlife is under threat from **habitat destruction**, **poaching**, and **climate change** 🌡️. By using **AI** to track and understand these animals, **BeloveThaiAI** will play a crucial role in their **conservation** and **protection**. 🦏

Our model also fosters a deeper **connection** between humans and animals, inspiring greater efforts toward **biodiversity conservation** and promoting a more sustainable coexistence. 🌱💪
